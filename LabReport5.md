The bug was in my HelloWorld.java file (like I guessed), where I put System.in.println("Hello World!") instead of the correct syntax for a print statement in java, which is System.out.println("Hello World!"). I used the TA's response to look up the correct syntax and compared it to my own code, where I realized the difference between the two.
